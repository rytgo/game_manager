# Game Manager

## Overview

This project implements a Game Manager using JavaFX to manage two fully functional games: Blackjack and Snake. The Game Manager incorporates persistent storage for user accounts and high scores, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and graphical frontends. It allows users to create accounts, log in, and view high scores, ensuring data persistence across sessions. The project also provides a unified toolbar accessible across the application.

## Design

The project follows OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: All game logic and data are encapsulated in their respective classes.
    
- **Abstraction**: Separate responsibilities for classes like `GameManager`, `HighScoresManager`, and game-specific logic (e.g., `Blackjack`, `SnakeGame`).
    
- **Polymorphism and Inheritance**: Shared functionality among players (human, computer, and dealer) is implemented through inheritance.

### Important Classes and Structure
#### Game Manager

- **MainMenu**: Displays the main menu, high scores, and provides access to the games.
    
- **HighScoresManager**: Handles loading, saving, and updating high scores.
    
- **LoginManager**: Manages user account creation and login validation.

#### Blackjack

- **Blackjack**: Core game logic, including dealing cards, managing turns, and calculating results.
    
- **BlackjackUI**: Frontend for the Blackjack game, handling user interaction and game state display.
    
- **Deck**: Represents a standard 52-card deck, with shuffle and deal functionality.
    
- **Player**: Base class for human and computer players.
    
- **Dealer**: Specialized `Player` with unique rules.

#### Snake

- **SnakeGame**: Core game logic for Snake, including movement, food generation, and collision detection.
    
- **Snake**: Represents the snake, handling movement and growth.
    
- **Food**: Handles food generation and positioning on the grid.
## Installation Instructions

To run the Game Manager, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Java 8 or later is required to run this project.
    
2. **Cloning the Project**: Clone the project from the repository or download the source code.
    
    `git clone https://github.com/rytgo/game_manager`
    
3. **Open the Project** using your desired text editor or IDE.

4. **Build the Project**: In our case, VSCode will automatically build the project when you save files.
    
5. **Running the Project**: Run the `App` class to start the application.
    
    

## Usage

### Game Manager

1. Launch the application.
    
2. Create an account or log in using existing credentials.
    
3. View high scores and select a game to play.
    

### Blackjack

1. From the Game Manager, select "Play Blackjack."
    
2. Start a new game or load a previously saved game using a save state string.
    
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to place bets, hit, or stand.
    
4. The game ends when a winner is determined. Progress can be saved and resumed later.
    

### Snake Game

1. From the Game Manager, select "Play Snake."
    
2. Use arrow keys to control the snake and collect food.
    
3. Avoid collisions with walls and the snakeâ€™s body.
    
4. Pause the game with the `ESC` key and resume as needed.
    
5. The game ends when the snake collides. The final score is displayed, and high scores are updated if applicable.

## Contributions

Each team member contributed to the overall design and testing of the system. Project integration and members assisted each other between all classes, but the description is a broad overview.

This project was developed as a collaborative effort among the following team members:

- **[Uyen Pham]**: Development of the Blackjack game, integration of logic, and its UI. Significant amount of bug fixing and code refactoring. 
- **[Kundyz Serzhankyzy]**: Responsible for development of the Snake game, including its logic of snake movement, food, collisions, and displaying scores. Wrote JUnit tests.
- **[Ryan Tran]**: Worked on login logic, game manager, its UI, high score logic, and encryption.
